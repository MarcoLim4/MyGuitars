# MyGuitars

There are a lot of little things I'd like to fix for this App and I am listing them all here. 

Eventually, when all the issues I want to fix are done, I will update this file. For now, here is what's coming:


- [x] Code clean up. Removing some commented code, removing/updating warnings;
- [x] iOS Bump to 18

### Repairs Bug

- [x] Not saving the repairs properly


### CoreData Migration to SwiftData

> Not sure yet if I will run a complete migration at once or entity bu entity. I'm pretty sure I will be redoing some of the screens. I will start with Strings and see how much effort. Then I will decide if I will split this in different tasks.

- [x] Instruments
- [x] Photos
- [x] Repairs
- [x] Strings

### Design

> I have a few changes I want to do on the design and this is the order I want. I will probably create a Figma file to list the changes I want to make.

- [ ] Cards (main screen)
- [ ] Repairs
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Instruments

### Unit Tests

> Since I want this to be part of my portfolio, I want to add some unit tests to the project

### New Features

> Under construction ğŸ’­
